# Smart Deployment Rollback Using AI in the Banking Sector

This open-source project explores the integration of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** into **deployment rollback mechanisms** within the **banking sector**, with a focus on enhancing deployment reliability, reducing downtime, and mitigating risk during software updates.

> ⚙️ Designed to simulate intelligent rollback decisions using machine learning in critical infrastructure scenarios like banking.

---

## 📘 Overview

Modern banking systems require high availability and resilience. However, software deployments can occasionally fail, causing disruptions, data inconsistencies, and reputational damage. Traditional rollback methods are often manual, slow, and inefficient — especially for financial institutions with complex infrastructures.

This project proposes and simulates an **AI-powered smart rollback system** that:
- Predicts deployment anomalies before full release
- Automates rollback to the last stable version
- Integrates with CI/CD pipelines and versioned environments

---

## 🔍 Core Features

- **AI Model Training** for anomaly prediction using real or synthetic metrics (e.g., latency, CPU usage, transaction failure rates)
- **FastAPI-based Inference API** to simulate production decision-making
- **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy** for safe environment switching
- **CI/CD Simulation** using GitHub Actions
- **Rollback Automation** triggered on anomaly detection
- **Banking-Specific Use Cases** focused on secure, regulatory-aware deployment behavior

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Scikit-learn** (ML training & prediction)
- **FastAPI** (model API serving)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD pipeline)
- **Docker** (optional for isolated environments)
- **Prometheus/Grafana** (for advanced monitoring, optional)
